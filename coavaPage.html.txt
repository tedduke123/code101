                    Founded in 2008 by Matt Higgins, Coava has had a physical presence in Southeast Portland on Grand Avenue since 2010. Expansion since then has been to another cafe on Hawthorne Avenue in addition to wholesale and online retail sales.
  Once you arrive at the coffee bar you will be offered a clipboard with the day&rsquo;s selection of coffees listing origin and tasting notes. Coffees are divided between whether they are offered in drip or espresso methods. The highlight of choosing coffee prepared with a Chemex is the use of an Able Kone filter which was co-designed by the founder. Additionally, Coava offers cold brew and a changing selection of local pastries.
  <p>Coava&rsquo;s cafes are located at:</p>
  <p>2631 SE Hawthorne Blvd Portland, OR 97214</p>
  <p>1300 SE Grand Ave Portland, OR 97214</p>
