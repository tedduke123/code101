                  <h2>About Us</h2>
                  <p>
                  Seizing the moment in 2009, WAC purchased a vintage, French-built 1974 Samiac roaster from a company in Switzerland, and set about building a new business around it. Having dozens of years experience in training and consulting in the specialty coffee industry, Bruce and Matt saw a great opportunity also to develop and showcase a retail and roasting business in same building as the American Barista & Coffee School, and share with new Water Avenue Coffee customers, the decades of combined experience to offer an unsurpassed level of support.
