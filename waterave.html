                  <h2>Coffee on the SE waterfront</h2>
                  <p>
                    Situated on the SE Portland waterfront near OMSI, Water Avenue has been in business since 2009 and is associated with the American Barista School. Water Avenue has a 1974 Samiac roaster which is on full display for patrons to witness coffee roasting while they sip their lattes. A full food menu is offered in addition to an extensive coffee selection. Hop over next door to purvey home coffee equipment at Clive when you are finished.   </p>
